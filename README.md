# Bus Pirate

This repository was forked on 03 May 2018 from the repo "BusPirate/Bus_Pirate" maintained by Agatti (Community version 7.1). Therefore, all the installation instructions, features are the same as the main repo's.

## Protocols
    
* 1-Wire
* I2C
* SPI
* JTAG
* Asynchronous serial
* MIDI
* PC keyboard
* HD44780 LCD
* 2- and 3-wire libraries with bitwise pin control
* Scriptable binary bitbang, 1-Wire, I2C, SPI, and UART modes.
